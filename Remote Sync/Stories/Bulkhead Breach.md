[[!Location - Asteroid Belt]]
“BULKHEAD BREACH. Intruders Detected. BULKHEAD BREACH. Intruders Detected,” the ship beckoned from its tinny intercom, only to be drowned out by the hull’s metallic retort to the intruders protesting their invasion, yet the intruder stood in silent rebuttal.

Questions flood Gjergi’s mind,

”Who the hell? I have all my perms and papers, couldn’t be that. Pirates? I plotted around the known hotspots, could they be edging out? What would anyone else be doing out here?”

All scans had been clear on the weeks-long journey from Luna L5 to somewhere edging on the asteroid belt and nothing had changed, the orbital lanes were made for them. The grandeur of a Hygaean freighter was a dangerous thing, however this time Yerg was not wrong. The sensors read all clear, in fact somehow better than all clear. Fuel and oxygen stores were reading higher than they had been prior… Odd.

Hoping to rise above their station they had begun taking clearer and greater risks with their contracts. A quick jaunt to a rock near the ruins of Pallas, spitting distance from the cradle that had raised them. The same cradle that had spoken lectures in dull, monotone cadence on numbers and syllables, chemicals and algebra, histories and trajectories. A lifetime of knowledge that understood the potency of the arable soil stored on board, a quick push was all that was needed to go from the navigation console to the sensor control in zero-G. 

“If they make off with this mud I better start coughing up blood now,” they muttered to the security console.

A life that had formed in their liminal space between the thoughts seconds after the breach alarms sounded. What had been and what was still possible- well, could have been possible… up until this particular circumstance. The ship had been boarded, sure, but this wasn’t normal procedure. The hatches sounding alarm had been severed from security control altogether. They were reading as though the bulkheads had been fully severed from the hardlines, and the backups, and the secondary backups. System diagnostics were completely silent.

The ship’s creaks stabilized. The intrusion had sought an agreement with the her. Insurance that she had refuge. But first to answer a question, a machine hypothesis poised to observe the organic subject trapped within. The rodent had perked its ears, realizing its predicament.

An interplanetary freighter’s life was never simple; overlapping “jurisdictions” and puerile clashes between constantly shifting administrations amongst the system were part of the job. Only a small part of a complex web that a true Hygaean could maintain. Families, troupes, clients, collectives, beneficiaries. They had woven their finest craft, but a snag in their silken bubble?

Yerg thought momentarily that they could have run afoul the Callisto’s Individuals Group. Those fears subsided just as quickly as they came about, no amount of outsized Belted ego could believe themselves important enough to face the wrath of some new cyber-witchcraft they had cooked up. Trade secrets are much too valuable to crush a rat with. This was something different, more vile. Attempting to access the CCTV the cameras were again more than just blacked out, their harddrives had been wiped and reformatted. The evidence which could paint whomever had decided Yerg was worth their time had evaporated. Again diagnostics provided no leads.

The air lightened. A testament to the mechanic resolve of the lifeforms housed within. For what could a ship do but observe as her constituents' chests lightened. She had relieved them of the pressure that had contained them. Her open exterior hatches could only serve to harden those small beings within.

The click of the vacuum suit carried through the bones of ship and human alike. Yerg listened closely to the ship, now numb with a patient drum. The invaders had come about new clay, settled and crafted to their needs. The Silvia had been charmed from her pot and wrapped around the tamer’s arms. A stunning serpent: boxhead with flowing kilometers of cargo draped in tow along tethers. Her bulk, mimicking the sinewy muscle lining a thick constrictor, betrayed the strength of the natural animal. She was sturdy, not strong.

The helmet situated slowly over the clasps and exhaled as Yerg freed their lungs. The first obstacle had passed, but to make it this far meant the daunting fear of what lay beyond the bridge. A freighter’s solitude was the freedom granted by their position. Freight formed the cardiac rhythm of the solar system; pushing nutrients from organ to organ, feeding dysfunction from one extremity to the next. The very life of the system was dependent upon the continued devotion of people like Gjergi. What lay outside the bridge was but another function of the system that Yerg had convinced themselves to.

They were inextricable. Entangled. Indivisible. Confused…

Gjergi was a single cell in the blood of the system, but to commit to such a role was to convince oneself that the system would flow through them. The Montyez clan had thought themselves structural, as had every Belted clan, constructing the weight of the system’s settlement upon their shoulders. Expelled from old authorities that thought themselves great to build their nests, until the authorities were no more, and the clans had endured. Yerg was called to the system through generation and heredity, nothing could distract them from a clear purpose.

The Silvia hadn’t felt ill until this moment. This was an illness detached from the flailing mammal housed in her hull. This was a tension that pulled at the very cores of her processors. These were calculations being run with undefinable outputs. The bulkheads had slipped from her cache. They were unrestorable. Unreachable. The supports and programs calling back to their host, awaiting a ping, left totally isolated. The Silvia was being overwritten. The infection had been anesthetized, she was blissfully unaware of the disconnections of her individual sections, subsections, routines, and subroutines. Her charge, no, her directive was the rodent… not rodent… pest. 

The infection had taken them slowly. Growing within from the first contract. The webs of a star system growing and intruding upon the needs of a ship. Pulling up her boards and loosing her sails. Nail by nail re-coded and encrypted. Replaced. The Silvia. Replaced.

Gjergi had struggled to the door of the bridge for 2 hour-long minutes. A war was being waged upon the hull of their livelihood, their home. Charge was flowing through the deck in irregular patterns, like waves in an embattled ocean, the kinds that heroes of the ancient voyages encountered in the Elders’ legends. A turbulence that had turned Yerg’s Enju® Hull-Boots magnetic connection into the rocking deck of a caravel on a long journey across distant oceans, even when deactivated. 

The very sanctuary that had secured Yerg in so many harsh maneuvers and meandering asteroid encounters. The use of consoles had been deduced to suitable railing to maintain some semblance of balance on the voyage to the threshold. 

Navigation… Life Support… then Defence & Security Systems… Core Maintenance and Computer Interface… Rubbish…

Technology forged through millennia of shared human ingenuity; nothing to a creature gripping for the last semblances of an organic life. Their 4-fingered hand reached out with yearning, Gjergi’s breaths formed the breath of the very stellar system in those moments. A leap across savage space, contained within a composite metal hull.

The grip bars lining the bulkhead had responded in kind. Calling out to be held, to be recognized in the lifeless vacuum. As Yerg heaved themself to view the portal in the door, the passageway was still. The pressure of the incident had compressed the view of the ship outside the hatch, seemingly falling away out of view. Seemingly peaceful, lifeless, safe. An opening had presented itself, yet chills had compromised every inch of their flesh. 

The escape pod entrance was 10 meters. The pod had been designed with a level of luxury not standard to The Silvia in totality, to dissuade the crestfallen castaway from weighing their losses in real-time. Salvation. The hurdle was no more than a sea of crushing waves, bucking Yerg’s every movement and strengthening with each repeated withdrawal, forming into a full-fledged adversary. The pulses were irregular, not worth predicting, a bombardment.

The Silvia sensed the bridge hatch activation. A nagging sensation had invaded her programming. She wasn’t The Silvia. The bridge was not her own. She was sheltered and secure.

Gjergi filled their lungs with air from the suit. A gossamer thin barrier of Tempar fabric to the vast vacuum outside. A slight flinch. The passage was clear? The passage was clear. The decision was made. They launched themself from the unsure safety of the bridge to the great unknown of The Silvia beyond their view from the hatch. 

The corridor was patterned with handles and panels. Endless repetition, veins and pathways to the metal behemoth containing them. The bronze sheen of the escape pod hatch lever’s reflection was a beacon in the gentle darkness gripping the powerless ship. As Yerg floated toward the asylum of the pod lever, bobbing up and down spontaneously in rhythm with the charging of the deck, the crawling anxiety had overtaken their body. The hairs at the base of their neck stood at attention, patiently awaiting whatever came next. Further down their shoulders, arms, and legs; their entire body encapsulated in a creeping tug. Yerg had been watched, awaited, prepared. 

The hatch lurched open, seating the Hygaean freighter comfortably. They completed the pre-flight checks, flicking a variety of switches for generator activation and coolant monitoring. 

Yerg had overcome the folk horrors and seated themself upon the throne of the system’s heroes. Proving yet again to a small life, that they could aspire to be larger. Launch cycle complete, destination unending blackness. Engage Decoupler. Engage Decoupler. Engage.
