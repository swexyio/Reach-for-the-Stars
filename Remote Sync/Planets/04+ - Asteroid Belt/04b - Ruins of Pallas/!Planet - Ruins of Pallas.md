Originally a twisted jewel of American hegemony, the first purpose of Pallas was as an off-world prison accelerated by laws regarding indefinite detentions becoming more stringent via popular sovereignty planetside. 

As the chain-gangs planted anchors deep into Pallas' crust they created a home for themselves, unsanctioned by their "betters". The deluded masters were mistaken in believing what they had created could be their own. As more modular units were added, and paved the way for expansion of this brave new world, and reorienting Pallas from purely incarceratory to manufactory and eventually to residentiary. 

The sub-levels of the spin-drives were dedicated to the imprisonment of individuals while the new additions represented a gleaming city of freedom for it's inhabitants.
