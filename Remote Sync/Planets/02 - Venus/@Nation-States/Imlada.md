[[!Planet - Venus]], [[Cytherean Confederated Grand Republic]]

Non-state tribal agrarian semi-nomadic culture, crossing the temparate south pole of Venus.

Landwardens search for the most fertile soil and productive grasses, and prepare temporary villages in these regions.

Gasmongers are small sub-groups within a tribe which serve as detachments from a primary tribe/settlement. 

Gasmongers also pioneer trade operations with the outside societies, procuring any items the band may need to make it through the harsh winters. Just as well if the Monger over-sells and falls short of the year's projections, members of their tribe: close family, children, lifelong friends, maybe left to freeze in the flash blizzards of the Imlada.

This culture of tight margins has produced a very conservative and close-knit people. Wounds in the tribe cannot be left to fester, or they may promote someone to act in way which endangers the whole settlement, let alone their close family unit.

If a foolish Gasmonger (Petrablyat) survives this hard period of winter, they are forever shamed and marked as a Leech for having risked each other member's life for their personal ego. The brand is in the shape of sharp-tooth gear, mimicking a permanent form of the bite of the coastal Levinia lamprey. The mark is made on the dominant hand. 

If the Petrablyat were to sever or deface this mark intentionally to cover it, they could be imprisoned by any of the tribes which abide by the Durament-custom, "a hardening of the people through a detachment of a 'diseased' part". Thus, they are referred to as Nuncabra: being lower than livestock. The Monger may be enslaved until they earn the forgiveness of their home tribes. Spiteful families will intentionally purchase Nuncabras from rivals tribes, with the intent to use that rivalry as leverage to hold the enslaved person for longer, and shame them further.
