[[!Planet - Venus]], [[Cytherean Confederated Grand Republic]]

The city is incredibly dense, built up to the edges of Alpha Regio and gradually reclaiming land to fit more vertical construction. 

Farming is done in cordoned off vertical segments of the city situated central to habitation blocks to facilitate easy commute.

Eve employs large amounts of fishing trawlers to dredge the local seas. 

Core drillers are isolated to the edges of the city about 3 sectors inward from the Oceanside to avoid floods. 

Eve docks are the 2nd busiest on Venus due to the condensed nature of the city's massive population. Raw elemental materials are shipped out in massive hopper containers.
