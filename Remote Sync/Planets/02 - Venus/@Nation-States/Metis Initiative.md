[[!Planet - Venus]], [[Cytherean Confederated Grand Republic]]

Founded technically in 2450, setting down it's first land-based research center in 2583, which would serve as the central authority for the continued management of the planet's ecosystem.

First branched out to the future land of the Confederacy of Independent Islands, in order to use the island chain to more centrally deploy aquatic fauna and flora to the wider oceans of Venus.

Established the Capital Regio as a colony in 2610, after it became clear that the colonists would need to be kept separate from the research teams.
