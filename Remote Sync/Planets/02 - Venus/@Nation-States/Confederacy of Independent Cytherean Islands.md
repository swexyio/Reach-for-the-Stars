Originally established to be headed by the Elder Houses of the Cytherean Islands by the Metis Initiative. Within 50 years of empowerment the Elder Houses began enacting legislation to the benefit of Rhea and the exclusion of Phoebe, Themis, and the Outlying Islands. , the people had begun small rebellions in local towns. Advocating for the dissolution of the Elder Houses in some places, others preferring to hold onto their Elder Houses for a sense of normalcy and for fear of what a leaderless independent island could result in. The Elders of Themis were founded as a counterpoint to The Rhean Houses shortly after the spark of hostilities. When the rebellion was settled, the previously federated Cytherean Islands became a Confederation. Still bound by common mission as each other's closest trade relationships, the Island Confederacy was established 80 years from the Empowerment of the Houses.

Executive Houses of the Island of Rhea
"Chiefdom Senior + Junior"
Structured surrounding the Houses of Rhea, each house (family) elects a representative. This representative is meant to convey the family's wishes to the political system, in which they are voted upon and sent to the Elder Houses. The 3 Elder Houses will approve or deny any item that comes to their table. A denial sends it back to the Lower Houses for voting again.

Phoebean Direct Democratic Experiment
"Direct Democracy"

The loss of control of the elder houses was met with a backlash desire for direct control of the levers of power. The Elder Houses had mandated the meshing of all residences networks into a single controllable network labeled "Honestas". The rebelling locals severed the mesh connection to the Rhea-Home Channel mesh, and repurposed the individual home networks into a functional program for Direct Sovereignty. The VÃ©nusienne brand of self-importance serves to uplift the integrity of the system, and the perceived efficacy has secured their brand of direct democracy
