[[!Planet - Venus]], [[Cytherean Confederated Grand Republic]]

The Big Three, the only government on the planet which can rival Ishtar Capital in power and system sway. 

Eastern Ishtar - Continental grasslands, similar climate to Great Plains. Active tech sector in various cities on either side of the Varwell Rise hills, in the Grayhill (Graphene) and Sonderburg (Solder) Valleys. Varwell Rise proper is home to the Terran spaceport which is also the main hub for the partners Tellus and Tethus. 
- **Main exports:** high tech (all sectors), grains and temperate crops, 

Tellus - Large island off the coast of Tethus and Terra. Primarily an industrial hub on the coasts where planitiawater can be used for cooling of equipment. Contains the highest density of traditional bluewater ports and piers on Venus to facilitate export of the goods no more than 2 miles away from any producer. The soft, chewy center of the island is primarily semi rural/suburban, feeding into either the port towns or the 3 medium-large cities: Tsellus, Robinston, Veneradnoye. A sub tropical climate means a variety of rare foodstuffs can be grown in the interior.

Tethus - Subcontinent-sized archipelago off the east coast off the Terran mainland. A largely textile based economy, growing local variants of sheep and wool bearing animals. Large exporter of milk and dairy products. Inland climate similar to Montana.
