## Terrae/Sub-terrae:

### Ishtar (Northern Terra)
 Split between the Ishtar Highlands and the Terra of Plenty. Two major political players: Plentiful Commune of Ishtar, Tellus, and Tethus; and the Capital Republic of Ishtar 
 **Export**: Fish, Salts, Chemicals, Politics   
 **Residents**: 
 - [[Plentiful Commune of Tethus, Tellus, and Eastern Ishtar]]
 - [[Ishtar Capital Regio]]

### Aphrodite (Eastern Terra)
Western Highlands are ruled by a more zealous religiosity. Diana Chasma is a fish and carbon product exporter. Artemis Chasma is a massive tech exporter, since her massive walls provide a natural cooling method for factories. The shallows of Aino Planitia and the shores of Lavinia are rich in silicon and carbon precipitate. The lands to the East of Dali Chasma are inhabited by descendents of some of the first waves of scientists from Ishtar 
**Export**: Rhetoric, Chipsets, Raw Chemicals

### Lada (Antarctic Terra)
  Artemis has exerted sovereignty on the coastal regions of Lada. The interior is know as Imlada and houses a more tribal people. Forming small, isolated communities amongst the ice floes and rocky shores of Lada **Exports**: Silicon, Carbon, Magnesium, Calcium sulfates precipitate

### [[Confederacy of Independent Cytherean Islands]] (Island Chain)
Local Coalition of Rhea, Phoebe, Themis, and local Regio. Responsible for a large amount of the biodiversity in the Seas of Sedna and Guinevere
**Exports**: Fish, grain, vehicles

### Sappho (Island)
 A sparse island populated mostly by anarchists. The volatile form of the Island chain's geology has created a near-nomadic roaming populace centered around mutual aid
 **Export**: Igneous Stone, Buffer, Fish

### Metis (Island)
Shared scientific outpost established by the Napoleon Accords. PCITT and Ishtar Capital were the first to engage in the accords. As neighboring Nations consolidated power they were "convinced" to participate in the Metis Project.
**Exports**: Science & Research

## Aino Planitia 
### Eve (Island) ​
As power was quick to consolidate on the more continental Terra, Eve maintained a rebellious streak fueled by corporate loyalty to Enju. Eve would establish an Enju enclave within Venus Territory. Even now 500 years from the founding of the GVR, counter-government elements persist in the undercurrent of Eveat society. The recently elected mayor has declared a hard-line stance against the GVR, motivating the GVR and Eveat Council to assume reactionary policies.
**Exports**: Craft Goods, Rice, Art

## Helen (Planitia)
### Achilles, Hector, Helen, & Patroclus
 The furthest from civilization one can be on the surface of Venus. Too far and too small to provide any real value to the burgeoning terran states. A small quantity of scientists has called this region home since their dead governments deployed them to this place. ​Export: Extremophile research, materials research,
