### IRL Data
Retrograde orbit
Well-built atmosphere 

From Wiki:
Triton's surface consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15–35% and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) the remaining 10–20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide. There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere. Triton's mean density implies that it probably consists of about 30–45% water ice
### Setting
Disparate trade-posts, as corporate interests grow outward in the system the smaller scale family run outposts are being franchised and pushed out of their own businesses

Small vac-settlements of Noxus and Refugees from the inner system dot the landscape. Usually based around Water Drilling or Mineral-Sifting

RTG based power systems.
