### Role
The CDMN is Callisto's main call to sovereignty in the Jovian system. They have established a network of defense satellites with intensely watchful eyes to the edges of their territory.

Daveed and other minor Jovian Corps have been put under strong pressure by their place in the Callisto SOI. They are looking to negotiate freedom from the grip of the sentinels.
