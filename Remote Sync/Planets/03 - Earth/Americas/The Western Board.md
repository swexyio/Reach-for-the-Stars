Representative Republic, Rotating Capital duties every 8 years

Every winter refugees flock to the gates and beginning in 2995, at the bicentennial of their coalition's founding, the UCWAS began admitting Scavs by the hundreds. The leadership seeing the influx of population as a necessary evil to engineer a loyal labor class with which to use as a knife in the side of the average laborers.

Scav slums have propped up around the outskirts of the individual cities, with families setting up permanently temporary housing lining the outer walls. Mothers, Fathers, Orphaned children all huddle around the drop-off points for the UCWAS deliveries sent by their families within the walls.

These villages take on the name of their drop-off point, i.e
- Alpha6
- Charlie19
