Enju Workers Housing Administration 

No more than a somewhat more luxurious shanty-town surrounding the main station-state which represents the seat of real power for the Enju Corporation. The Jackson HQ is specifically used by Enju nobility as a retreat and workstation. The EAZ is largely factory space and the nobility are portioned out fiefdoms. Residences form the polygonal core of each factory blocks with each face present factory space for expansion. The largest Fiefs are centered around the pre-collapse city-centers, further out Fiefdoms are established and increasing tithes are paid to EnCom and Enjendarme in order to increase their effective zoning space.
