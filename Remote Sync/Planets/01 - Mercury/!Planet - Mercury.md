7 Independent Cantons - Planetary Congress

Oldest lasting representative government in the system, the [[Hydrargyrum Petrocratic Union]], due to it's establishment by Earth-Govs as a neutral and amalgamatory body to restructure the conversion value of energy to dollars in 2237, after a floundering United States doomed the USD and caused the Oil-Producing countries to intermittently trade in other currencies considered more stable in their current climate. Mercury was colonized with the express purpose of meeting energy concerns necessary to the functioning of global society. 

Goethe was the first settled crater, as it was well positioned for a year round energy relay. The settlement at first was built into the walls, with the relay being built from the bottom up, appearing to be carved directly from the crust of Mercury. As power began to transmit to the relay and materials were shipped via old, slow chemical rockets, Goethe would prove the process that each subsequent settled Canton would. Weighted curtains were used to capture an area for atmosphere, with a massive telescoping awning built directly into the Crater walls. As the mining activity of the sector picks up pace the awnings are extended and the curtains pushed further. Oxygen is produced via greywater electrolysis. Ice shipments this far sunward are especially pricey, but for the Union it was a drop in the bucket.

The land relay ceased to function in the 2500s, but was at that point already obsolete by orbital relays kept aloft by a low-mass orbital truss armed with maneuvering thrusters and linked to Psychopomp-1 as the central control axis. While Cantons maintain Cratertops for integral energy production and radiation shield, they also maintain claims in the LMO range for orbital sails. Cantons can then sell this energy via the Goethe IF trade system.

Representatives allocated dependent on population as a percentage of the total census, times the duration of commitment to the elected coalition. As a coalition defines itself in policy and is defined by the voters decisions, the congresses which held the most power over the previous, outdated policy were demoted to minor members.

### Cantons:
#### [[Valmiki & Surikov]]
Co-Sovereigns of the Beethoven crater, proceed sharing set up between Valmiki and Surikov to outsize their possible influence alone. Both are individual cantons despite the objections of their peers.The deciding votes for the referendum to merge the settlements politically are held by Cervantes and Sholem Aleichem, a puppet of Surikov and political expediency for a shared claim. If Valmiki were no longer able to exert influence separate from Surikov 
##### **Exerts influence over:** 
- Matisse-Raphael-Haydn-Chekov-Schubert Crater Belt to the East- 
- Tolstoj and Dostoevskij to the West
- Vieira da Silva to the North. 
- Complete security of Beethoven. 
- Surikov does some dealings in Michelangelo and Ma Chih-Yuan, where cooperative contracts with Cervantes behoove them.
- Surikov is secretly supporting the growth of the Cervantes Canton with hopes of forming a Triple-entity, and holding leverage over Valmiki in their relationship.
- Seats of Commerce - Schoenberg/Valmiki - Sayat-Nova/Surikov
#### [[Sanai-Aneirin]]
- A Canton merger, the expected future for Valmiki & Surikov should their political stability shift. As a dual entity, their government is unhappy with their lot in life and comes into conflict with Surikov in Hayden-Chekhov-Schubert, and Valmiki in Matisse-Raphael
- The unfortunate overlap of their craters, rather than a buffer zone such as Beethoven, had resulted in the Cantons having no choice but to merge as their infrastructure began to overlap and compete. After 15 long years of competition and dwindling QOL for the locals, the individual canton governments merged in 2879 to form Sanai-Aneirin and cooperate.
	- **Exerts influence over:**
	- Homer, Renoir, Kuiper, Goldstone Catena and Wren to the West
	- Ellington to the East
	- Mendes Pinto to the South. Pushkin disputed territory with Cervantes.
#### [[Vaneckspear]]
Half-Canton: Keeps a tight hold over Caloris. Near-Dictatorial and almost always under advisement from the other Canton's Politburo's 
	- **Exerts influence over:**
	- Atget, Apollodorus, Nervo, Brahms, Verdi to the West
	- Strindberg, Akutagawa, & Region surrounding Cahokia Vallis to the East.
	- Complete Security of Shakespeare. Van Eyck is the pre-eminent political power of the settlement pair.
#### [[Cervantes]]
South-most and newest Canton on Mercury. Recognizes Surikov's vassalizing influence and works to manipulate Surikov in return facilitating greater growth to the fledgling Canton 
	- **Exerts influence over:**
	- Bach, Ma Chih-Yuan, Smetana, Michaelangelo to the Northeast.
	- Pushkin to the East.
#### [[Sholem Aleichem]]
Large Jewish diaspora population. Policymakers are consistently on the side of egalitarianism throughout history, and ensuring that full-representation is valued highly in the Hydragyrum, lest dictator assume total control of their Canton and seek to influence fellow Cantons to come to heel.
	- **Exerts influence over:**
	- Complete security of Vyasa, Gradient of control to the outer 5 Buroughs
	- Praxiteles, Hugo, Larrocha to the South. Vivaldi disputed territory with Valmiki and Sanai-Aneirin. Sanai's claim is dubious at best, but keeps Valmiki from being the undisputed suzerain
#### [[Mendelssohn]]
- **Exerts influence over:**
	- Rustaveli-Copland-Rachmaninoff Ridge. Rachmaninoff is in open revolt in favor of Sanai-Aneirin and dissidents walk openly in the streets. 
	- Raditladi, Munkascy, Sveinsdottir, Kunisada to the South
	- Borealis Planitia to the North. 
	- Currently attempting to subvert the Goethe polar Interplanetary Shipping Hub. By implanting agents in varying levels of the administration they hope to add Goethe to their SoI, a feat previously never thought possible.
