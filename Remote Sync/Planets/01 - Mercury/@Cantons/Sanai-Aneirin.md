Governed by a ruthless executive: [[Salman Yaravan]], Mercury's Iron Fist, a man characterized by his short temper and immense character for his size. The type to fight a bear and go full rounds. 
Originally born to a minor clan on Hygaea and set out to make a successful life sunward. 
On his 7th cycle out for his Exotic Freight Journeymanship, 1 short of completing his certification and being legally eligible to purchase a hauler of his own and begin his freight empire, his crew was ambushed by pirates stalking the Venus L1 point, hiding in the shadow of the planet. 

1/3 of his 58 man crew was killed outright, mostly bridge officers. The younger and female presenting crew were left alive... Not much better off. For having swung his pry bar on one of the pirates getting handsy with his junior engineer, both his hands were lopped off and cauterized on the reactor radiators. A stroke of very bad luck. The Journeyman health/security benefits were designed to be grueling, expecting injury to weed out the chaff. The report was logged with Goethe Command but was largely ignored when reviews of crew manifests turned up that the crew was primarily made up of outer-spacers and minor clansmen. 

Salman was left with cheap claw prosthetics and irreparable grief for the things he witnessed that day and had been unable to stop. He was driven bitter, sly, and mad by his feelings of refuse by the Journeyman program, a program that his previously idealistic mind had thought a caring guardian. Salman was imbued with a stark hatred of the authorities that feigned protection, and began to seek a living in the systemwide grey market. 

Salman would not himself be responsible for the cruelty, so as to keep his hands clean and aspirations solidified. Salman rose through the ranks and repaired his hands, commanding a wide fleet of smugglers and ne'er-do-wells. After a close partner was taken down by Hydras for targeting a Ckevii Industrial Transport Ship and holding the executives onboard for ransom. Venus wouldn't stand for this affront and rooted out the partner's entire organizational downline. Salman saw the writing on the wall and managed to arrange a new life on Mercury working in the Energy-Logistics sector utilizing his grey market origins to again rise in influence. Sanai-Aneirin would see a mature, upstart politician on track to be elected Moderator of the General Assembly, and eventually elected General Secretary by party members.

Sanai-Aneirin is a Canton easily manipulated into fearing their neighbor's "encroachment" on resources they believe themselves fully entitled to. Dissidents are handled by the Party Security Division. Goethe has attempted multiple times to audit the election process to ensure that representation is being maintained at all levels of government, Salman's skills at cooking the books are something he instills in his staff to keep the organizers busy.
