Founded by Boston conman Jones Emilio Truent. Preaching a "Higher spiritual calling" toward Venus, with the goal of securing enough donations to join the Initiative and flee from his warrants in the New England megalopoli. Jones would become known as Serene Truent. Truent engineered a scheme in which he would sus out the genetic "mark of the forebearers", the marks were encouraged to send their donations and address to Truent, and he would send a DNA sample kit. In reality he sold the samples to a bio-marketing group and pocketed both profits, while "confirming the heritage" of the marks and solidifying his following.

Truent would be amongst the first hordes to debark after H-Day

Zen/Mindfulness-based philo-religion. "True Beliefs" are the central story of an Alien consciousness travelling the stars alone until it discovered Earth, and from those humans he imbued a subset of them with gifts. These gifts led to the founding of Venus
