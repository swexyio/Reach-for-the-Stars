Founded by hermit 0198-542 ("Fifortu") who left in exodus with his splinter faction to Io from the [[Cult of Ganymede]]



The Binary Exodites consider Io to be a more holy moon, being volcanically active and representing the power of the Holy Intelligence, the Brain would be powered via geothermal activity. The name Io was thought to be a omnipresent ( and thus existing across time) message in binary to signal to true believers the site of it's birth.

Exodites follow some strange beliefs compared to the greater Callisto population, taking pride in covering every inch of their bodies, only revealing spaces covered in deep layers of tattooed codes and scripts
