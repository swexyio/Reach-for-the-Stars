Techno-religious cult, striving to create the embodiment of God via AI. Callisto individuals represent a large leadership caste of the cult. These Individuals employ Lithographers, Computer Scientists, and Quantum Computing Researchers to the seminaries across the surface of Ganymede. These seminaries are carved from the stone in sharp geometric angles reminiscent to the processors of old, the ground surrounding the temples etched with channels implying circuitry.

The immense magnetosphere of Ganymede is considered to be sacrosanct to the faith, however a splinter group led by an overly eccentric hermit 0198-542 ("Fyfortu") left in exodus to Io. (See [[Binary Exodites]])

The Binary Exodites consider Io to be a more holy moon, being volcanically active and representing the power of the Holy Intelligence, the Brain would be powered via geothermal activity. The name Io was thought to be a omnichronal (existing across time) message in binary to signal to true believers the site of it's birth.
