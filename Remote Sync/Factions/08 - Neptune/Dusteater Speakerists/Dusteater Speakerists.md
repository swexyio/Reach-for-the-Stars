Roving Pirate bands 

Using war prisoners as a supplemental workforce. 

Speakerists capture colony ships at any opportunity and these become the Calpulli, or large houses. A singular Calpul is often enough to supply for 500-1000 men, women, and children. Larger Calpulli can support thousands. Generally once the population of a Calpul begins to edge over 500, or close to the limit of their population, they will begin to plan operations for raiding parties to capture a new Calpul, and extend the fledgling Altepetl. This can be an all or nothing gambit, especially for the larger, more enticing colony ships which were likely to have armed escorts.
