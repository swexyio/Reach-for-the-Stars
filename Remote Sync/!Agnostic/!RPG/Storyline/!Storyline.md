### Storyline 
We meet our crew at Goethe IF dayside. Goethe is a bustling trade hub, being the location with the most concentrated wealth in the system. Glittering architecture is visible from the windows of the primary tower representing cultures from around Earth, with newer additions further out from center representing whole planets of cultures. As we continue looking out the window a massive freighter comes gently launching from the interior of one of the peripheral. This is somewhat discomforting due to the sound-dampening of the windows, leaving something with the power of 10000 nuclear warheads being channeled in the launch tube, safe and reliable for hundreds of launches per Working Cycle from Goethe alone. As the freighter breaches Mercury's paperthin atmosphere the thruster assist tugdrones fall back to the launch tower and orderly rearrange themselves alongside.

Back inside, the sounds of rushing channels of people moving to-and-fro in the massive ecology mostly drown out the sounds of local launches taking off from their center tower and monorails ferrying individuals between the shipping terminal, the residences surrounding it, and the planetwide transport.

Basic Locations:

- Bar: McGinty's Liquid Gold. Currently owned and operated by  Hakeem Al-McGinty (63), 13th generation grandson of the founder. One of the oldest pubs on Goethe, calling back to the times when Saudi and Qatari oil-Emirs were roaming the halls. Enron McGinty went to painstaking efforts to keep his business afloat out of a mostly dry population, but gradually the Freight Agency grew and with it came laborers and dockworkers from a variety of cultures. McGinty's is a flashback to the mid-20th century as you walk inside, the dark-stained faux-walnut counter tops and wainscoting covering the walls. A bastardized image cobbled together from the memories of an old man recalling the sappy stories of his grandfather's youth. The doorway transitions smoothly from cold dark metal, to patterned wool carpeting at the doorway seemingly picked straight from Old Irish country, and onward to EasyWipe Oak-simula flooring. Privacy booths drown out any outside noise and disable any eavesdroppers. The bright green color of the seats inside drown out the mountains of stains accumulated in the nearly 800 years, atleast half of that since they had been reupholstered. Here the crew will meet with their contact of the mission they had been summoned to Mercury for; Douglas Gogunov will meet the crew and explain to them the mission from a privacy booth in the Liquid Gold. Prior to beginning their conversation he will pull a small medallion from his coat pocket and set it on the table. After a brief pause, sparks will fly from one of the walls and Douglas will explain that they are being entrusted because they are unassuming. This deal is being scouted out by a threatening pirate collective which intends to derail their relations with Daveed Hyperstructors. Daveed has been expanding the SoI of Jovian factions deeper into the Belt with passive scanners and defense systems. Arcadia is happy to maintain isolated and reliant upon their fingers on the pulse of communication that connects the system.

- Hangar: Zodiac Hangar-85D. A bustling and hyper crowded cross-section of the Goethe towers. About 1/3 of the way from the top lies the intermodal hangars which unload from the minor cargo transporters and load the massive Freighters of the system's far-flung supply chains. The center has a thick barrier wall separating the main launch column from the wandering populace in the open segments of the hangar bays, each being purchased from the EarthGovs and rented out by minor landlords to make dock fees on the side. The sides of the bay are lined with various shops for any possible need. Being a central and very rich port, Goethe has a thriving personal sales industry for startup crews to find anything they may need for the missions or jobs that lie ahead in their future.  Once they're nearing complete shopping they'll be called to the dock slip to be scolded by the Dockmaster for their ship taking up space and that the higher-ups have a job for them. Send them to McGinty's on Level 1 AmSec (American Sector) and have them return to the Dockmaster before heading out. 

Your crew has been hired by the Kim-Shor Financial Collective, the most powerful banking institution in the solar system. Specializing in Energy to Matter technology and pioneering the drive into the modern age of Helions as the prime currency and legal tender system-wide.

The Loan Agent Gavin Borizond (34) is in need of an armed escort to Eschelon P (Rho) to meet with the liason to Skeldos Miragron, Senior Chief of Production Imfo Adelotku (62)

Adelotku is a grizzled marine veteran and left the Earth service to live his life out in luxury aboard the Jovian Eschelons.

Borizond is a pretentious Venussiene Tranquil. Believing himself to be a financial gift to the solar system

On the travel back to the dock have them roll a DC16 Perception check, on success they'll find a body stripped of finger-nails and teeth, wearing the clothes of the homeless man. Investigate check on whether they recognize the body: if 17 or higher then they recognize it's Douglas. 16 and lower they believe it's the homeless heckler they encountered in the hall/bar. 10 and lower they have no clue, he's too destroyed.

Upon returning to the Dockmaster you'll pass a pair of sullen fellows, one wearing a deer antler tattoo peaking from under his collar. Dockmaster will be visibly shaken and will tell the crew that he's thankful to finally be rid of them.

Remora lock escort - Larger Kim-Shor escort vessel that allows the party-ship to Remora lock to them and provides a heavy firepower escort for a majority of the trip. Clearance to travel past Mars is not granted, they must turn back (DC 5 rolls for ambush, Remora-Host will annihilate the attempt) 

Ship combat with Cornelius en-route, provide pilot with 3 options: Fast route (Guaranteed combat), Efficient route (DC 10), Prescribed route (DC 5). Crit fail guarantees an interdiction. 18+ Guaranteed Arrival

Depending on combat, have Gavin offer to charge repairs and food to the company, allow them to convince Gavin to pay for basically anything they want. Upon arriving at Callisto for repair, offer the group to go to a port bar, since Gavin is disgusted by the thought of disguising himself as is custom on the moon, where they can have food. These "Brittles" live like ants in a farm linked into VR for 90% of their lives. It all makes him sick but they do damn quick work.

The party will encounter Vikus Ruger, Lead Detective at Hydra Customs. Following up investigating a daemon that made it onto a Goethe terminal he managed to trace back to Callisto. Vikus reunited Gavin with his brother Jonny after he was captured and held for extortion by Cornelius. Jonny came back severely disfigured and clinging to life, but he was able to die at home surrounded by family. Roll Perception for Vikus at disadvantage on **Lone Wolf** since he's been drinking after clocking his hours for the day. (DC5)

Once they arrive at the destination and negotiate the final terms, 30.9 Million Helions will be loaded into the ship. This is a 0.1% payment to on the loan taken for Eschelon Î£, of 30Bil total contracted. 

The **Cornelius Sleepers** implanted in the crew will be informed of the presence of this cargo as it is being loaded. They will be offered 10% each to betray the crew and kill Borizond and/or Adelotku in the meeting room and escape on board their ship. **Lone Wolf** will be offered non-mission objective, Escape with the money.

Create a statblock for Quad-Leg robot guardian intended for the hangar. If things go down factor a way to transport it wherever it may be needed. Thinking starts out similar to centipede with many little legs toting it around. Maybe allow the party to engage it in this form and be surprised by it transforming.


If the **Sleepers** make a getaway, have every surviving crew roll Perception. CDIU Mantis droid: the "Straps" on the cargo come to life and unsheath 3ft long blades. Either have them detect and disable, or be unaware and be killed. Non-traitors will roll w/ advantage.

If non-traitors survive the getaway, have the traitors decide whether to strand or kill them. If stranding then choose Himalia to leave them on and found 2 new factions, otherwise found 1 new pirate faction, decide whether they're subsidiary to Cornelius or if they're striking out on their own
