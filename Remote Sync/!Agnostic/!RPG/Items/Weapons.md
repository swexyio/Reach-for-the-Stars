#### Headslicer
Massive Slicing blade intended for severing entire limbs and heads in one swipe. Can be curved or straight

#### Tranquil Submission
Large club-like bats with a thick channel down the center on one side that provides 2 striking "heads" of the bat. Prized for its ability to cause severe internal trauma through a suit. Named so for their part in reuniting the societies of Venus after the first fall of Earth. In a first in history, this technology has a backwards trajectory making it back to the wastes of Earth as a tool for ambushing lone Spacers to salvage their supplies.

#### Gutter
A rapier with a liquid metal core which increases the effective piercing mass. On Earth the liquid metal action can be "recreated" by scrapping magnets that require full purchase to reset, and will be unusable until manually reset if missed.
