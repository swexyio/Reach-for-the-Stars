Real life gov org - State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_exclusion_zone#Administration

On Earth the exclusion zones are primarily managed by powerful corps. Enjoying usage of the old cities, crumbled ruins, and CBRN wastelands to fight their new wars amongst themselves. Vying for more territory or to undercut a more powerful adversary in a distant outpost. Some corps are not above enslaving the locals, however such a corp could be labeled a persona non grata, after an immense and taxing trial. 

Where there is a sizeable local suzerain there are generally disputed regions of neighboring EZ's. More often disputes are resultant of state-corporate meddling. The EZs contain massive stocks of usable scrap, which some suzerains claim for the riches they hope to pry from the ashes of their ancestors. Otherwise suzerains or rising sovereignty with political motive in the area may purport a wider claim. 

The local populations of Earth-Govs are generally left unmolested, however their mere existence within the EZ has been designated "Illegal", any acts of sovereignty or popular movement stemming from these Zones is extinguished with brutal prejudice, under the label of "terrorism"

The varied EZ's of the rest of the civilized system are generally managed and policed by the local sovereign. Some non-state actors may collaborate with the sovereigns to develop the EZ jointly, however at least on paper these Zones are beholden to the sovereign's laws.

In the case of (con)federated systems, they have a singular organization each on the federal level, which has varying levels of jurisdiction amongst each other.
