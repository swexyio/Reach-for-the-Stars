Formed in the final of a merger-spree undertaken by Noble. Prievib Taylor, First Grand Foreman, had established a cascading contract which would cede shares from operating investors to subsidiaries of Noble and her allies. Therefore putting Noble in position to assume a monopoly over the Venusian metals trade. 
Backed by the support of Ckevii Design after a particularly fruitful joint-venture to capture an asteroid for Centaur mining and signed over the carcass to CDIU to have a clandestine shipyard built within it. Noble did not ask questions and CDIU was never happier.
