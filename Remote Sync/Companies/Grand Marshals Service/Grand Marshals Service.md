A private organization on the payroll of the planetary sovereigns to maintain their neighborhoods. The Grand Marshals are rumoured to be some of the most capable individuals in the system. 

Grand Marshal Branch Headquarters are scattered around the celestial sovereigns. Each branch operates a majority independently, but they do claim the role of the only entity capable of policing and enforcing across planetary sovereign boundaries. Each modern sovereign is a signatory of the Charter which established the GMS, in some instances by force. 

> Ye could have a million bounties on y'head and live free as a bird, but you have a single Marshal come 'round and you're either a jailbird or a dead bird. - 'Dead-Hand' Nils Schoenbaum
