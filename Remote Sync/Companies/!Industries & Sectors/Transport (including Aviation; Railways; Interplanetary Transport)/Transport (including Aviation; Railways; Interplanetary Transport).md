Transport is a crucial driver of social and economic development. Investments and gross domestic product expenditure in this sector are important, as it ensures mobility and trade. Transport subsectors - road, railways and civil aviation - employ many workers in a wide range of job categories. The ILO provides a tailored approach through numerous decent work strategies to ensure the sector’s resilience and sustainability. Main efforts include promoting social dialogue, workplace occupational safety and health, workforce gender balance, improving working conditions, and analysis of employment relationships and their impact on decent work.
