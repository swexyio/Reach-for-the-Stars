[[!Industries & Sectors]]
This sector is comprised of four sub-sectors: Shipping, fishing, ports and inland waterways.  
  
**Shipping**: The ILO, since its founding, has adopted many international labour standards for seafarers. In 2006, the 94th Maritime Session of the International Labour Conference adopted the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006. The Convention consolidated nearly all earlier ILO standards for seafarers into a single Convention. The MLC, 2006, entered into force on 20 August 2013, establishing minimum working and living standards for all seafarers on those ships.

**Inland Waterways**: Inland waterways play an important role in the transport of goods and persons in many parts of the world. Inland navigation personnel are faced with unique living and working conditions which require special consideration by the ILO. The aim of ILO activities in this sector is to achieve decent work for all inland navigation personnel.

**Fisheries**: Fishing is one of the most challenging and hazardous occupations ILO is working to ensure decent work for all fishers. The ILO’s international labour standard concerned specifically with work on board fishing vessels is the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 (No. 188). This Convention demonstrates the renewed commitment by the ILO to ensure decent work in fishing.

**Ports**: As the transport sector has become increasingly competitive and global, many developments have taken place in the organisation of work in ports which have affected labour and social conditions in the industry. The ILO has a major role in the collective efforts that aim at providing socially responsible solutions to the challenges faced by the port sector.
