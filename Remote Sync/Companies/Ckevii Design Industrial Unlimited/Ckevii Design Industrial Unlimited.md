Venusian quasi-governmental corporation. A political affiliation in their own right, CDIU is the bedrock for the might of the Venusian mercantile fleets. Both commercial and state fleets were fully outfitted by CDIU, with preferred loans to Venus-born individuals.

Relationship to the [[Cytherean Confederated Grand Republic]] is institutional. The founder of the GRV signed off a special section of the Venusienne constitution to provide near complete sovereignty to CDIL, change Limited to Unlimited, designed to grow in tandem with the fledgling Venusienne government and meet the needs of the fleet. The need to receive favor from Ckevii and Venus in tandem is called "The Orthrus"
