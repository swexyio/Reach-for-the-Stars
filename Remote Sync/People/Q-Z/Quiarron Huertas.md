## Story

A political refugee from The Dominican Republic, Quiaron's great grandmother their family patron, saw the writing on the wall. The Turks & Caicos were not the first region to be subsumed by the sea.

Doña Jardinera (Gardiner) leveraged her position at a local drydock to purchase an aging and barely functional Pitchfork Hovercraft. The light ship had been engineered to cut large squalls into fine ribbons as they crested the nigh-bladed convex hexagons that comprised the hull. As the large family powered southward away from their generational home, the feeling finally sunk in that they would never see their island, their home, above the waves again.

Once they arrived on Hispaniola, a shining mountain amongst the sinking Antilles, they settled in the overpacked refugee housing that was set as a buffer between Santiago de los Caballeros and the encroaching waves. 

Over the generations the refugee camps that remained became cemented and permanentized. An entire underclass sprung up clinging to the seawall of SdlC with layers reaching vertically up, just below a hastily-painted red line that denoted the acceptable height so as to not insensitivize the wall jumping chases that had become all too common as the settlement languished in poverty.

La Doña, as she became known, lived situated on one of the original lower sections of the rickety favela labeled "Calle Caicos", became a leader to the populations making their way in this new world. She consoled those that were stricken having lost their families, and as the waves of refugees arrived and the settlement Jagstown needed to expanded further, she repurposed her mechanical skills to expand the scaffolded construction. 

La Doña was instrumental in sealing off the lower settlement and engineering the pump system required to keep the settlement dry while the populace relocated further skyward. Doña spent her life preserving the safety of the settlement and it's people, and was immortalized by the growing population of Jagstown by naming their first University after her. 

Once the Neoliberal Dominican government had enough pressure put on them by the masses of human lives pounding at their seawall, they began permitting limited integration between the Settlements hugging their walls. Gradually the remnants of Jagstown were all but abandoned aside from the very poorest population which has struggled to maintain. The Huertas family had been forcibly relocated due to the "Class" assigned to them due to their family wealth, transitioning into government housing and from there the generations after would forget the lessons and cultural connections forged in Jagstown. The Huertas continued to frequent the Jagstown threshold to provide mutual aid and created a network with which other families of Environmental Diaspora of means could provide assistance to their siblings in exile.

In Quiaron's youth through trips with his mother and father, he took to a deep love for the community and people of Jagstown. His father, Neto, had followed in the footsteps of his Bisabuela by pursuing a career in engineering, working in the power generation sectors of the Seawall. 

Luz, was a Dominican-descended altruist and volunteered her free time to Jagstown. The couple met while Luz was in pre-med and working as a volunteer in the Red Cross Infirmary. Neto had taken a friend of his for a torn muscle after he had fallen from a ladder. Luz cared for Neto's friend professionally and deftly while continuing casual conversation. She had obviously been caring for people since she was very young, and took her talent seriously. 

He took to watching her glide from viewing screen to table to patient and back in between. She was as close as someone out on the walls could get to an AyuDOMO, the latest automated medical innovation out of the Cuban Graviér Medical. Neto took to slightly more proving questions about where she was attending university and was she had planned to pursue after. 

"I know I'll have to find work in public practice, possibly a hospital..."

"Those spoiled bastards over in Santi-" Neto interjected,

Luz cut him off, clearing her throat and continuing, "but my dream is to establish a fully-funded hospital in Jagstown. If I could, all of the people on the Walls would have access to the Ayudollas"^1

1. Ayudollas is a pejorative name for the Graviér AyuD-pattern medical bots. Dollas meaning "Dolls" and Ollas meaning "Pots", this is a wordplay portmanteau.

She was singing to him, and he was once again taken aback by her tact and care for all of his siblings in exile. She had tripped his breakers, and all that he could manage was to stare at her longingly.

After wrapping up and setting the Proteinated Linens which would assist the muscle in healing, Luz turned her full attention to Neto. Noticing that his jaw was on the floor she felt unnecessarily gawked at, and chased the pair nearly completely out of the infirmary before he could work out the words,
"I was staring out of admiration for your skill, that's all!"

She slowed and her features lightened somewhat. She had been deeply flattered,
"Get out, I have patients to see," now lightly blushed rather than flush with rage. 

As the weeks passed, Neto seemed to more often cut himself on a raw girder joint or hammer his hand, all "accidentally" of course. After one of the many injuries were dealt with, Luz pulled him aside and informed him of what a dilemma this had caused. 
"If you keep coming in," she said in a hush, "I will have to consider you an actual patient."

Neto was slow on the uptake and took this as an off-handed remark. As much as he could read the pangs of hunger on a mother's face or the darting eyes of an orphaned child, the latter of which were worryingly common as of late, he was clueless to the indications she had given him. Neto returned to work pondering the details she had laid out to him so clearly. 

As the day neared a close he sat for a breather with Beto, the original friend whom had met Luz with him. 

Beto asked plainly to break the silence, "Neto, why haven't you asked her out yet? You know you don't have to hurt yourself to see her."

Neto immediately knew who he meant, and feigned offense at the implication that he would be so motivated. 

A slight pause, while Beto composed his next set of words between lively bites of an empanadita. Neto had slunk back into his relaxed posture and looked to Beto with an intensity waiting for him to finish.

"If she didn't want you to keep coming she would have told you as much."

Neto retorted, "She just did! She told me if I kept coming in I'd be a patient. What could that even mean? I've been to the infirmary now 6 times, how can I not be a patient already?"

Beto looked excitedly at his clueless friend, hoping he would make the connection. The silence was palpable for him as Neto had nothing to add. 

"Tu Pollito, doctors aren't supposed to get with their patients, so then that means..."

"Wait is that for real?" Neto responded, "Doctors aren't supposed to date their patients?"

Beto looked on in shock as he felt his good friend still hadn't absorbed what Luz had meant, and answered plainly, "Nah man, it's unethical... Haven't you taken Ethics in University yet?" 

Neto sat slackjawed, dumbly glaring at Beto, answering his question without a word.

Beto followed up, "More importantly, she's saying there's a chance, and if you don't knock it off there won't be!"

This caused a stir in Neto. Beto had taken a hammer right to the rust on her words and shaken free any misunderstanding. He had forced the puzzle pieces into place. 

Neto launched from his depressed posture on the bench, nearly into a full sprint. Beto had recoiled slightly from the sudden shift and tucked his empanadita into his bag, yelling after Neto

"I hope you're not **just** going to sign up for a class!"

Neto made his way back to the infirmary and found Luz fingering through charts and diagrams. She had the same methodical precision he had seen every time he came to her. 

She was expecting it to hit him at some point, and was hoping he wouldn't hurt himself to get back here. She looked him over sceptically, slowly raising her focus from the papers in her hand. 

"Couldn't even come up with a new injury this time?" she started in.

"No.. I.. uh.. well" his tongue had become tangled, and he had nearly forgotten why he came down here while trying to tame it. She looked back down to her work and began to turn away when he shouted sheepishly, "Wait! I was just thinking about what you said earlier and... I would like to ask if maybe you wanted to come with me to a banquet"

"Banquet?" She thought to herself, "So he's some rich kid doing poverty tourism? What gives."

"Maybe not," she replied in a quick, awkward breath. She has robbed the wind from his sails, but he continued in a weaker voice, "it's for the Children of the Diaspora, my father founded the program that puts it on. I'll be working but it'd be cool to see you there."

This gave her pause in turn. His work here wasn't for image, it was for family.

"You have my attention," she piped up.

"It'll be at the dancehall on Calle Nuevo Caicos," the words were a broken dam flowing from his mouth with excitement, "Uh.. this Friday at 7pm!"

"Okay, I'll see," she responded calmly, while her mind raced with the same excitement that was so audible from the boy. The cute young man in front of her could not contain his anticipation, gentle shaking his balled fists as he turned to leave with an energetic twist.

"Aren't you forgetting something?" She called after him. He turned back and gave her the same dopey look he had given Beto just a few moments ago. A moment passed and broke the silence, "What's your name?"

"Henry, but everyone calls me Neto. And you?"

"Luz"

Neto gave a cheesy smile and quipped at her, "Luz... ¡Que de-luz-cioso!"

The pun had brought on the crinkles in her brow and, with a look of shy disappointment, Neto quickly shuffled out from the large tent.

That Friday, Neto sunk himself deep into his work. Running between assisting the cooks and helping his younger sisters pin up the decorations. His sisters, Blanca and Johnna, had worked with the other children in their school class and had convinced their parents to take a trip to the government housing day school to create multiple banners in each culture's language so that everyone from the Diaspora could feel welcomed. The dancehall was alive with energy before the party had even begun, volunteers moving back and forth. A tall, dark-skinned man commanded gently from the center of the room, still wearing his day suit from the office, pointing and delegating amongst the many tasks that had to be done in the next two hours. Neto approached the man in the center. As he parted the crowd, a warm smile appeared on his father's face in the center.

Sr. Huertas looked at Henry with a gleam of nostalgia, now only a few inches shorter than himself, his boy had grown so fast while he was distracted with the world around them. Of course, Neto hadn't felt neglected, but this was one of the many anxieties a father like Maxwell contends with.

"Papá, what would you have me do next? I've helped the girls with the signs and the chefs told me I was starting to get in their way."

Maxwell's emblematic toothy grin turned to a quizzical smirk, he would wear himself out at this pace.
His father parried his pointed question and responded with leisure, "Play some games with your sisters, my boy. They won't always be this bright and cheerful!" 

The warmth had shone through his voice and uplifted Neto. Normally he, as a 19-year old man seeking to emancipate himself from his family, would be resistant to the offer, but the method of his father's words always moved him to amenability. 

At his father's behest, Henry played with his siblings. Playing jacks and then cards, Mia is a veritable card shark even at the age of 12.

He had raised Neto and his siblings with a tenderness that those who didn't know him would mistake for weakness. 


A hardline traditionalist and individualist political party, Voz De Dios, began a meteoric rise through fear mongering over the Refugee policies of the Republica's past governments which sat as a bulwark of Neoliberal ideology late into the millenia.
