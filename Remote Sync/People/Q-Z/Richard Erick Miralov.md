Raised in a poor Cantonal Housing Authority district knowing only his Father. His young mother died shortly after his birth by walking onto the sunward surface to escape her parents and debts that came calling. His father, Oleg Miralov, was a simple service worker in a local Omnitav #wip . It was a rundown place that only hired Oleg since he was cheaper than the energy costs of a Servdron #wip . Oleg spiraled into debilitating addiction after Lonnie's death. He spent the first 11 years of Richard's life as a hapless addict, forcing Richard to fend for himself more often than not. 

Richard grew into a bitter yet resourceful youth. Engaging in low-level nonviolent crimes in order to ensure the Housing Authority dues were paid, he stayed vigilant and clever enough to keep a clean record. His work at the Local Canton School was exemplary and he graduated with top marks, allowing him to enter work training very early on. Through clients of some recreational drug dealers he has been introduced to a lawyer whom offered Richard an apprenticeship. Erick Lustat specialized in Commerce and Logistics which he recognized in Richard very early on when talking to him. Erick dreamed of the ability to allow Richard to assume a greater station and see success which was so unlikely for kids from his district. Richard representing a local Mercurian Agency against a Ckevii-Venusienne team. Mercurians saw this as striking back against the leviathan of Ckevii and escalated Richard to regional fame in more Cantons than just Goethe.
