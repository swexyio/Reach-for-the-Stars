![[Izaia-gazon-concept-65yo.png]]
Founder of [[Enju Aerospace]], in the wake of the 2nd 21st Century Financial Collapse he bought up wide swaths of manufacturing and launchstrip territory. 

Born in January of 1998 as a sickly diminutive child of Blue Collar parents. Mother, Jolene, a union electrician and father Paul a carpenter and odd-jobsman.

Izaia quickly sharpened his wit as he saw the toil and struggle his parents went through. However his parents favored his younger brother Nam, and so he became distant and withdrawn. Izaia moved out before his 17th birthday and began executing his plans.

He pursued a degree in business and aerospace from an Ivy League school via direct qualifications in a contest to test balloons used in flight in the atmosphere of Venus. Izaia secured a graphene manufacturer and designed a self-replicating balloon that was meant to expand insitu from the size of a toaster oven to over 40km in diameter. 

Upon graduating Iz returned to his home of Jackson, Michigan to find the destitution unbearable. Through deals and sly transactions, Izaia was able to secure a simple manufacturing space and airstrip, and began pumping funds into his local infrastructure and community. Within a year Iz became a local hero.

Enju was founded in 2022 to entrust the property to, but laid dormant until the 2nd Great Recession in late 2028. Businesses were going under along with the banks that owned their land. The financial system appeared to be fully dissolving and Michigan was rife with poverty. Lands that hadn't previously been foreclosed had gone under. The corporations that had been buying up land had seen their bubble pop and were nearly all sent into a death spiral, shedding assets and employees attempting to break even.

Izaia began implementing local work training programs to pick up jobs in his factories, having efficienly integrated suppliers doing the heavy lift for profit. Enju ballooned from 6 employees in early 2029 to over 80,000 by Jan 2031, the first recruiting call for Civil Servants. 1200 workers enrolled in the corporate owned para-union in 2031, and the numbers only continued to boom.
